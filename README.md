## Angular Data Table

This is a forked version of https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-2-data-table that has been updated to Angular 8.

A simple Angular data table, with built-in solutions for features including:

- pagination
- sorting
- row selection (single/multi)
- expandable rows
- column resizing
- selecting visible columns

The component can be used not just with local data, but remote resources too: for example if the sorting and paging happen in the database.

The templates use bootstrap CSS class names, so the component requires a bootstrap .css file to be present in the application using it.

Check out the [demo](https://stackblitz.com/github/vdo2000/angular-data-table) for examples of how to use it.

## Installing:

`npm install angular-data-table --save`
