## Angular 4 Data Table Bootstrap 4

This is a forked version of https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-2-data-table that has been updated to Bootstrap 4 and Angular 4.

A simple Angular 4 data table, with built-in solutions for features including:

* pagination
* sorting
* row selection (single/multi)
* expandable rows
* column resizing
* selecting visible columns

The component can be used not just with local data, but remote resources too: for example if the sorting and paging happen in the database.

The templates use bootstrap CSS class names, so the component requires a bootstrap .css file to be present in the application using it.

Check out the [Demo](https://afermon.github.io/angular-4-data-table-bootstrap-4-demo) and its [Code](https://github.com/afermon/angular-4-data-table-bootstrap-4-demo) for examples of how to use it.
